# PrivateDetective
This is a Spy Android application. Running this application will take photos using the front camera and sends them to the given email address in the code. This application does not have the UI. It just runs in the background. 

I had built this application to capture photo of a thief who has stolen an android tablet. This application should be used with collaboration of other application like <a href="https://github.com/UdaySravanK/MyBankAccounts">MyBankAccounts</a>. After pushing the **PrivateDetective** app to the stolen device through the paly store, we also have to push **MyBankAccounts** app. When a person using the stolen device tries to open the **MyBankAccounts** app, actual **PrivateDetective** app will be triggered behind the scenes and starts taking picture with a fixed interval and keep sending them to an email address. 


**Caution:** I have made this application available here only for learning purpose and Google will suspend your account if you publish it on play store. 

_Yes I was successfuly able to see the face of a thief._
